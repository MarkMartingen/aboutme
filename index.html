      <p>
Education-wise, I am rooted in mathematics. Except for a two-semester stint studying mechanical engineering,
          mathematics has been my true calling.  In 2002, I completed a thesis on percolation theory on
          trees and earned a Master of Science degree at The University of Warsaw. Before that I earned a Bachelor of
          Science degree after submitting a diploma work that dealt with
          groups acting on trees through automorphisms. Next to mathematics, Iâ€™ve also been fond of computer science,
          and although I have no formal education in the field, I have spent thousands of hours learning to code and writing
          programs starting with Basic, Pascal, Fortran, SQL, VBA under excel, C, Octave, Python and R.  As machine learning
          algorithms (or data science, if you will) began their victory march in terms of popularity,
          I also got more interested in this topic. In 2019, I completed a one-year post-graduate university course on
          data science with applications. My diploma work was to train a
          computer to play tic-tac-toe using reinforcement learning.

My professional activity has had two main strands. Thanks to my analytical background, I have held jobs that required
          data processing, creating reports and building predictive models. I worked on managerial reporting for
          insurance companies and for a mobile phone company. I modelled insurance tariffs and predicted sales.
          A few years into my career I took up project management (and people
          management along with it) and worked mostly on delivering upgrades
          to various IT systems. This included gathering requirements
          negotiating with stakeholders, overseeing implementation and
          testing. To some extent project management was fun but I quickly
          realized that I am someone who prefers to get his hands dirty.
          Afterwards I worked as a data scientist for over a year at a
          fintech company and later as a data analyst in the e-commerce
          business.

        I am currently looking for an interesting and also meaningfull job in
          which I would be fore mostly:
        <ul>
<li>Coding and working with data</li>
<li>Solving analytical problems</li>
<li>Building computational models </li>
<li> Being part of a team and in an environment of mutual support where creativity can flourish and growth can occur </li>
         </ul>
      </p>

In my private life I am a married man and father of two wonderful teenagers, a caretaker of two cats,
          an avid gardener, a leisure sailor and a motorcycle enthusiast with a knack for repairing old motorcycles.
          When working on a bike, I am often under the impression that solving mechanical issues resembles
          solving mathematical problems. The thinking process is similar although the tools are different.
          Instead of applying theorems, calculations, or other mathematical entities,
          I reach for wrenches, pliers, drills, files and so forth. This similarity may be one reason I enjoy this hobby so much.
