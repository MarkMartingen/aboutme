      Education-wise I am rooted in mathematics. After a one year misadventure wit mechanical engineering, I’ve always considered mathematics to be my true calling.  
 In 2002 I completed a thesis on percolation theory  on trees and earned a Master of Science degree. Before that I earned a Bachelor’s of Science degree  submitting a diploma work that dealt with groups acting on trees through automorphisms. 
     Next to mathematics I’ve been also fond of computer science, and although I have no formal education in the field, I have spent thousands of hours learning to
      code and writing programs  starting with  Basic, Pascal, Fortran, SQL, VBA under excel, C,  Octave, Python and R. 

      In general,   dabbing with science in an important part of my life. Some of my friends regularly amend their reading lists, other maintain lists of TV series
      worth watching. I have a list of things that I would like to study and experience the bliss of at least gaining some insight before my time is up.
      Currently, the top  of  my lists includes quantum computing, reinforcement learning, statistic learning theory, relativity theory (what is time?), 
      stochastic processes and stochastic calculus, homology theory and formal logic.
