      <p>
Education-wise, I am rooted in mathematics. Except for a two-semester stint studying mechanical engineering, mathematics has been my true calling.  In 2002, I completed a thesis on percolation theory on trees and earned a Master of Science degree at The University of Warsaw. Before that I earned a Bachelor of Science degree after submitting a diploma work that dealt with groups acting on trees through automorphisms. Next to mathematics, Iâ€™ve also been fond of computer science, and although I have no formal education in the field, I have spent thousands of hours learning to code and writing programs starting with Basic, Pascal, Fortran, SQL, VBA under excel, C, Octave, Python and R.  As machine learning algorithms (or data science, if you will) began their victory march in terms of popularity, I also got more interested in this topic. In 2019, I completed a one-year post-graduate university course on data science with applications. My diploma work was to train a computer to play tic-tac-toe.

Dabbing with science is an important part of my life. Some of my friends regularly amend their reading lists, others maintain lists of TV series worth watching. I keep a list of things that I want to study, enjoying the experience of gaining at least some insight into them. At the top of my list nowadays are quantum computing, reinforcement learning, statistical learning theory, relativity theory (what is time?), stochastic processes and stochastic calculus, homology theory and formal logic.

My professional activity has had two main strands. Thanks to my analytical background, I have held jobs that required data processing, creating reports and building predictive models. I worked on managerial reporting for insurance companies and for a mobile phone company. I modelled insurance tariffs and predicted sales. A few years into my career I took up project management (and people management along with it), which went well but made me realize that I am someone who prefers to get his hands dirty. Currently, I am involved in business analysis and function point analysis, i.e., measuring the functional size of applications.

With time, my appetite for a meaningful and satisfying job has grown. I am eager to return to data analysis, this time at a level of sophistication that includes exploitation of machine learning algorithms and modern data processing methods. My dream job, one that I am still searching for, will require of me foremostly:
        <ul>
<li>Writing computer programs working with data</li>
<li>Solving analytical problems</li>
<li>Building computational models that explain or at least offer predictions of some phenomena based on data</li>
<li> Being part of a team and in an environment of mutual support where creativity can flourish and growth can occur </li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>
In my private life I am a married man and father of two wonderful teenagers, a caretaker of two cats, an avid gardener, a leisure sailor and a motorcycle enthusiast with a knack for repairing old motorcycles. When working on a bike, I am often under the impression that solving mechanical issues resembles solving mathematical problems. The thinking process is similar although the tools are different. Instead of applying theorems, calculations, or other mathematical entities, I reach for wrenches, pliers, drills, files and so forth. This similarity may be one reason I enjoy this hobby so much.
